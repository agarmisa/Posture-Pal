PosturePal is a test-driven Ruby on Rails application that integrates the Twilio API, rake tasks, and Heroku Scheduler to send postural exercise text alerts to users three times throughout the work day. PosturePal incorporates an AJAX counter for users to log the number of days they have performed their exercises, and the Ruby gem Merit to host a badge system for gamification of the application.

While working as a physical therapist, I found that most of my patients with neck and back pain sat for most of their work day. Patients with the best posture were those who practiced throughout the day. PosturePal was developed to take the stress out of remembering to sit up straight.
